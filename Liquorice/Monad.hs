Module      : Liquorice.Monad
Description : Liquorice functions under the `State` Monad.

Stability   : experimental
Portability : POSIX

Core `Liquorice` functions for building maps. These are all under the
`State` Monad, the state which is passed around is the `Context` being
operated on.

Many of these functions are wrapped versions of those in `Liquorice.Pure`.
