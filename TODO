What's next?

 * first interesting example map (port from WadC?)
    * fleshing out thing types, texture functions, etc.
 * handling randomness
    *  possibly the others too, not terribly interesting as demo maps!
 * Tidy up Line tests, add more, remove stupid ones
 * more quickcheck properties?
 * rename to Liquorice?
 * is there (or define) an inverse composition operator so we can avoid
   explicit lambda in HoFs like quad, pushpop etc.; or, would that be
   overall too confusing

 * generation order, rework Render.hs tests to reflect (final?) ordering

        let's try always prepending in Context, and doing the same
        in the walk to WadMap, inverting the order.

            oh god this is not fun

 * generic haskell / derived Binary instances for Wad?

demo maps / main key points over wadc?

    random dungeon generator with avoiding clashing. via a blockmap? (possible
    in wadc although ugly). or via querying the existing structures

    modifying existing structures. line warping/bending?

    "overdraw" in some way.

* thought: arguments to box/ibox are unclear since they're all ints
  if the x,y was a tuple, it would be less ambiguous

birds todo:

second cyber?
textures:
    liberally sprinkle indoors outdoors around the place
    inside all marble (inc floor), cutouts for white stones
much wider cutouts
alignment: new nice buttons (use edged ibox?)
fancy play/return for symmetric shapes (courtyard, and spokes)
skybox
remove gallows
    put them back in as post-draw cut thing?
"with_sectortype / with_linetype"?
