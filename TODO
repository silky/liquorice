What's next?

 * handling randomness
    *  possibly the others too, not terribly interesting as demo maps!
 * Tidy up Line tests, add more, remove stupid ones
 * more quickcheck properties?

 * generation order, rework Render.hs tests to reflect (final?) ordering

        let's try always prepending in Context, and doing the same
        in the walk to WadMap, inverting the order.

            oh god this is not fun

 * generic haskell / derived Binary instances for Wad?

demo maps / main key points over wadc?

    random dungeon generator with avoiding clashing. via a blockmap? (possible
    in wadc although ugly). or via querying the existing structures

    modifying existing structures. line warping/bending?

    "overdraw" in some way.

* thought: arguments to box/ibox are unclear since they're all ints
  if the x,y was a tuple, it would be less ambiguous

* Doom/* should probably not depend upon stuff in Liquorice. Move common
  definitions (abstract Linedef etc. types) into Doom/*.
